	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the size of the input to the program. The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, to express the rate of growth of time taken with respect to the input size. An algorithm is said to be efficient if its time complexity is less.</p>
	<p>Space Complexity is another important aspect of an algorithm's efficiency. <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of physical memory that an algorithm needs to complete its execution. It's usually expressed in terms of Big O notation, like <b>O(n)</b>.</p>
